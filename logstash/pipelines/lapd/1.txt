# File input plugin
Documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-file.html
You will learn how to read files from logstash.

1. Fix 1.conf and run logstash with --configtest parameter. Verify the configuration is OK.
2. Run 1.conf job in logstash. Verify that all lines from the csv file appear in your console.
3. Notice the ".sincedb" file in your directory. 
	This file keeps a pointer to the location that logstash has proccessed the file so far. 
	If you don't delete it, logstash will not read the file from start but from that pointer.

4. Delete this file every time you want logstash to process the file from start. You will need to do this for the next excercises.
