# Clean and format your data
You will learn to parse dates and to clean your data.

date_occurrence and time_occurrence track our datetime value. 
We want to have only one field with this information. 
Furthermore, we want to eliminate extra white spaces from address field.

1. Use the mutate filter to join date_occurence and time_occurrence into a new field "datetime".
Documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-mutate.html
Look at the add_field setting.

2. Once we have joined the fields, we do not want to keep them. Remove date_occurence and time_occurrence.
Look at remove_field setting.

3. Parse the date using the date filter
Documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-date.html

Here you will find the right timezone, put the data into the @timestamp field and remove the datetime field.
