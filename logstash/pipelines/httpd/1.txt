# Grok filter plugin

Documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filter-grok.html
You will learn how to structure data from inputs using regular expressions.

Start with 1.conf and proceed with the exercises under in the given order.
If you need help, you can take a peek at 1.fasit.conf or ask the speakers.
Try to run logstash at each completed step to make sure you are on the right track.
Remember to delete the file at sincedb_path between runs, ensuring logstash processes the whole input file again.

1. Have a look at the access.mini.log file. Replace <path to elk-workshop> with the path to the elk-workshop repository. Try running logstash:

> ..\..\..\logstash-2.1.1\bin\logstash agent -f 1.conf
$ ../../../logstash.2.1.1/bin/logstash agent -f 1.conf

Notice the value of the field *test* in the outputs.

2. If you look at the *match* option of the grok filter, this may not look like any regular expression you've seen before. DATA is a pre-defined pattern for grok regular expressions equivalent to ".*?" (without the quotes). The :test within the pattern tells grok what field to bind the match to. As a whole, it is equivalent to the regular expression "(?<test>.*?) ".
